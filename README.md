## Synopsis

RoboSandbox (rsb), an open-source Python package, invented for robotic manipulator design and analysis. The design goals are:
- **user-friendly**: it is easy to install, use, and interact with. A nicely designed interative application is provided for robot design and analysis.
- **accessible**: it is open-source, well-documented, and well-tested, and can be accessed on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- **extensible**: the code structure is extensible, allowing for the easy integration of new features and functionalities, such as the incorporation of additional indices to measure robotic performance.
